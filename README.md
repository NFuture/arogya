## Inroduction

A mobile application that can provide farmers with various useful
information and facilities. The application is written in flutter which makes it cross platform and
the server is based on a flask, a python based framework.

The main feature of the application would be disease recognition through images. The user can
simply take a picture of the afflicted crop and the application will determine which disease it is
and suggest suitable methods. The image search is done using a Content Based Image Retrieval
(CBIR) system written in python. This essentially forms the most important aspect of the
application, enabling farmers to retrieve information through the universal medium of images.

Other features include a compendium listing out various diseases and pests and the best methods
to counteract them. Another compendium have detailed analysis on crop rotation. It also
shows weather reports, alerting of severe conditions, so that necessary steps can be taken. It will
also contain a local news section, which reports on agricultural policies, signs of pests / disease,
insights into the price of various crops.
